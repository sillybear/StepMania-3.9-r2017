[ScreenGameplay & ScreenEdit]
  - Fixed Assist Tick start time bug by adding global song offset seconds to it

[ScreenEdit]
  - bpm and stop numbers in notefield has no trailing decimal zero now.

[NotesWriterSM & NotesWriterDWI]
  - These will not output in sm:
	> metadata with blank values (sm and dwi)
	> metadata with default values (when OFFSET is 0 and/or SELECTABLE is YES)
  - All numbers (except step data) have no trailing zeroes. Decimal precision for beat seconds is 5 while others (bpm, numSeconds & groove radar data) is 3.
  - removed measure number tags
  - removed -nosongbg- in BGCHANGES
  - default BGCHANGES value is changed from
	0=[movie file]=1,1,1,0 to 
	0=[movie file]=1,0,0,0

[Others]
  - changed default sample music length from 12 to 15
  - removed possible banner lookup conditions. This fixed the bug
    where jacket image is loaded when the song has no banner.
